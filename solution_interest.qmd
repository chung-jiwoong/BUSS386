# Computational Exercises


---

## Value at Risk (Problem 1)

Solution:  
The standard deviation of the daily change per asset is \$1,000. The portfolio variance is  
  (1,000² + 1,000² + 2×0.3×1,000×1,000) = 2,600,000.  
The portfolio’s daily standard deviation ≈ √2,600,000 = \$1,612.45.  
Over 5 days: \$1,612.45×√5 ≈ \$3,605.55.  
Since 1% tail corresponds to 2.326 standard deviations, the 5-day 99% VaR is  
  2.326 × \$3,605.55 ≈ \$8,388.

---

## Value at Risk (Problem 2)

Solution:  
Using the duration model, daily change SD = Duration × Portfolio Value × daily yield SD  
  = 5.2×6,000,000×0.0009 = \$28,080.  
For 20 days: \$28,080×√20.  
The 90% quantile for a normal variable (1.282 SD) gives  
  VaR = 1.282×\$28,080×√20 ≈ \$160,990.  
Weaknesses: This method assumes only parallel shifts and linear price–yield relationships, which may not hold in practice.

---

## Value at Risk (Problem 3)

Solution:  
Calculate the portfolio variance from gold and silver positions and then find SD.  
Variance = (0.018×300,000)² + (0.012×500,000)² + 2×300,000×500,000×0.6×0.018×0.012 = 104.04 (in thousands²).  
SD = √104.04 ≈ 10.2 (in \$1,000s).  
1-day 97.5% VaR = 10.2×1.96 ≈ \$19,990.  
For 10 days: \$19,990×√10 ≈ \$63,220.  
Calculating individual VaRs for gold and silver and subtracting from the sum gives a diversification benefit of about \$7,438.

## Interest Rate Conversion

Solution:  
(a) Continuous compounding:  
  Rate = 4×ln(1 + 0.14/4) ≈ 13.76% per annum.  
(b) Annual compounding:  
  (1 + 0.14/4)⁴ – 1 ≈ 14.75% per annum.

---

## Bond Pricing

Solution:  
Discount future cash flows at 10.4% (with semiannual compounding) to get  
  Price = 4/1.052 + 4/1.052² + 104/1.052³ ≈ 96.74.  
Then solve for the 18-month zero rate R from  
  4/1.05 + 4/1.05² + 104/(1+R/2)³ = 96.74  
yielding R ≈ 10.42%.

---

## Par Yield

Solution:  
Set the present value of cash flows equal to 100 and solve for coupon c. The par yield is approximately 7.07%.

---

## Forward Rates

Solution:  
Using the given zero rates, compute forward rates between consecutive quarters. The answers are approximately:  
 • Qtr 2: 8.4%, Qtr 3: 8.8%, Qtr 4: 8.8%, Qtr 5: 9.0%, Qtr 6: 9.2%.

---

## Forward Rate Agreements (Problem 1)

Solution:  
Compute the FRA-implied forward rate using  
  [(0.06×0.75 – 0.05×0.50)/0.25] ≈ 8% which is above the FRA rate of 7%, indicating an arbitrage opportunity.

---

## Forward Rate Agreements (Problem 2)

Solution:  
Convert the semiannual rates to continuously compounded rates, compute the forward rate for the six-month period starting in 18 months, and then value the FRA on \$1 million using standard formulas. The computed FRA value is approximately \$1,124.

---

## Bond Prices and Interest Rate

Solution:  
By bootstrapping zero rates and then computing forward rates and par yields, the answers are found as in the provided table. The two-year bond with a 7% coupon is priced at approximately 102.13 with a yield of about 5.77%.

---

## Duration (Problem 1)

Solution:  
Duration quantifies the sensitivity of bond prices to yield changes. Its limitations include the assumption of small, parallel shifts and linear approximations which may not hold for large changes.

---

## Duration (Problem 2)

Solution:  
For the five-year bond:  
 (a) Price = 8e^(-0.11) + 8e^(-0.22) + 8e^(-0.33) + 8e^(-0.44) + 108e^(-0.55) ≈ 86.80.  
 (b) Duration ≈ 4.256 years.  
 (c) A 0.2% yield decrease increases price by approximately 86.80×4.256×0.002 ≈ 0.74, raising the price to ≈87.54.  
 (d) Recalculating at 10.8% yields a price of 87.54, confirming the duration estimate.

---

## Duration of Portfolios

Solution:  
(a) Compute the weighted average duration for Portfolio A and confirm it equals 5.95, matching Portfolio B.  
(b) For a 0.1% yield increase, both portfolios decline by approximately 0.59%.  
(c) For a 5% yield increase, Portfolio A falls by about 23.82% while Portfolio B declines by about 25.73%, showing Portfolio A’s lower convexity.

## Zero-Coupon Bond Valuation in R

```r
# Function to value a bond
bond_value <- function(face_value, coupon_rate, periods, discount_rate) {
    # Calculate the coupon payment
    coupon_payment <- face_value * coupon_rate
    # Calculate the present value of the coupon payments
    pv_coupons <- coupon_payment * (1 - (1 + discount_rate)^(-periods)) / discount_rate
    # Calculate the present value of the face value
    pv_face_value <- face_value / (1 + discount_rate)^periods
    # Calculate the total bond value
    bond_value <- pv_coupons + pv_face_value
    return(bond_value)

# Example usage
face_value <- 1000
